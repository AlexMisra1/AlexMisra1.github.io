To whoever comes upon this, greetings! 

I’m Alex Misra, a senior at Henry M. Gunn High School here in the Bay Area. 

From my posts, you would probably assume that I am enthusiastic about documenting the natural world through photography—and you would be right. My story with photography goes way back. In the summer of fourth grade, my grandpa visiting from Minsk brought along his DSLR. He taught me all about how to operate it, but I never really took on photography as he had hoped. It wasn’t until my junior year that I discovered my interest in it by taking a photography class. Specifically, it was when we were taking pictures of the surrounding nature at our school. I’m very passionate about the environment, but nature photography allowed me to relish the details and intricacies of what we really care about when we say we’re passionate about the environment.

Taking AP Environmental Science this year has allowed me to take my goal of environmental protection one step further. Not only does it make appreciating natural beauty more meaningful (since I can now understand why certain formations arise, look the way they do, or how they have been impacted by human activities), but it has also made the possibilities endless in terms of how I want to apply my approaches for environmental protection (the computer-science-based and human-connection-based approaches) to create solutions. 

Shifting gears from environmental protection, I'm also deeply involved in karate. It's something I've been doing since I was seven years old. The initial appeal of “looking cool” and the ability to engage in physical combat is what attracted me to it. In my over ten years with it, however, I’ve learned that it’s so much more. Karate is a way of life, a life where you choose how you want it to be lived, but also a life where you hold yourself to being self-aware, mindful, and dedicated to self-improvement. 

Something that I started about a year and a half ago is tutoring and mentoring at Lauren’s House. Before joining Lauren’s House, I knew the value of community, but it wasn’t until I joined it that it became a personalized experience for me. Joining Lauren’s House, I saw genuineness, I saw compassion, I saw inclusion, I saw ingenuity, I saw inspiration—and I saw change. It’s one thing to be able to contribute to a mission, but it’s another thing to see the direct change. At Lauren’s House, I see the youth there forming into fine individuals, and having the honor to actively contribute to that holds a special place in my heart.

I feel like it's general consensus to keep these "about me" pages short—or at least shorter than what I've already written—so I would probably say the last thing you should know about me is my love for Pickleball and its positive impacts. I've seen how it has transformed the local community in Palo Alto—to the point where the courts stay packed well into the night. It made me think: what better way than to bring that sense of community to my high school to help solve the mental health crisis? That was just over one and a half years ago, and how we have a vibrant Pickleball Community here at Gunn High School. It's amazing to see how far starting Gunn High Pickleball Club has come, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.
