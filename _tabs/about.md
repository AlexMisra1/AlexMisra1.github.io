To whoever comes upon this, greetings! 

I’m Alex, an incoming senior at Henry M. Gunn High School here in the Bay Area. 

From my posts, you would probably assume that I am enthusiastic about documenting the natural world through photography—and you would be right. My story with photography goes way back. In the summer of fourth grade, my grandpa visiting from Minsk brought along his DSLR. He taught me all about how to operate it, but I never really took on photography as he had hoped. It wasn’t until my junior year that I discovered my interest in it by taking a photography class. Specifically, it was when we were taking pictures of surrounding nature around our school. I’m very passionate about the environment, but nature photography allowed me to relish the details and intricacies of what we really care about when we say we’re passionate about the environment. 

Going to a completely different realm, an additional great interest I have is Karate. I’ve been doing it since I was seven years old. The initial appeal of “looking cool” and the ability to engage in physical combat is what attracted me to it. However, in my ten years with Karate, I’ve learned that it’s much more than just that. Karate is a way of life, a life where you choose how you want it to be lived, but also a life where you hold yourself to being self-aware, mindful, and dedicated to self-improvement. 

Two other great interests that I actually have are mathematics and computer science. Math has always just been different to me. It fascinates me how it can be so intricate, complex, and have areas that are so vastly different—areas tied by fundamentals that are so hidden but enlighten new perspectives when discovered. Seeing that similarity in computer science piqued my interest in it as well. In FOOP and CSA, each difficult Scheme exercise problem was inherently different, and cracking them inclined me to do the next one, and the next one, and so on. The importance of computer science in the modern world also piqued my interest in it. It has so many applications, and I want to embark on journeys to create those applications in order to combat environmental harm, whether that be by advocacy or simply making a product.

Something that I started about a year and two months ago is tutoring and mentoring at Lauren’s House. Before joining Lauren’s House, I knew the value of community, but it wasn’t until I joined it did it become a personalized experience for me. Joining Lauren’s House, I saw genuineness, I saw compassion, I saw inclusion, I saw ingenuity, I saw inspiration—and I saw change. It’s one thing to be able to contribute to a mission, but it’s another thing to see the direct change. At Lauren’s House, I see the youth there forming into fine individuals, and having the honor to actively contribute to that holds a special place in my heart.
