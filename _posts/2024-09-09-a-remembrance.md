Today's post is a little bit different from what I normally post. In case you don't know, today marks exactly four years since those devastating wildfires turned the sky orange in California on 9/9/24—four years since I started my journey of environmental protection. I can hardly believe that it’s been this long already. Four years ago, I remember thinking how this event was the build up of decades and decades of environmental negligence. I know I mostly reflect about the beauty of nature on my blog, but I think it’s important that you guys understand that protecting the environment is more than just appreciating the awe of nature—that it requires action. Even though that catastrophe is often labeled as one-of-a-kind and not something to worry about, the point is that it shouldn’t have happened in the first place. It set the stage for what’s to come if we don’t take action now in changing how we treat our planet. Below I've attached some YouTube videos that I think really reflect the scale of the issue.
