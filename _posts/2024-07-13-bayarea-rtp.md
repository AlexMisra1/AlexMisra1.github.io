Last week, I had the wonderful experience of visiting the East Coast for the first time. In particular, I visited the Research Triangle Park (RTP) area in North Carolina, which comprises Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill. Fun fact: the reason why it’s called Research Triangle Park is because of the three highly regarded educational and research facilities of Duke University, UNC Chapel Hill, and NC State University situated in those cities respectively of which have geographical positions that form a triangle.

Stepping out of RDU International Airport at night was a surreal moment for me, especially as a native Bay Arean. I had never experienced weather like this. It was a humid eighty-four degrees, and I was sweating more profusely than I anticipated. This fascinated me, and was my inspiration for this research into the myriad differences between the two vastly different climates. I did this specifically by documenting the vegetation through photos that I took.

## The Bay Area and RTP's Climates

Both places are relatively near the coast. The impact of the coast is reflected on the changing vegetation as you get closer to it, which reflects the changing climate. Thus, documenting one type of vegetation for each place wouldn't paint the full picture of how the vegetation reflects the climates for both places. That is why for each place, I've documented vegetation that's more in-land and vegetation that's closer to the coast.

### RTP’s Climate

Like much of the Eastern states, North Carolina's general climate is classified as humid subtropical.

#### More In-land Climate

RTP's more in-land areas can be described as having:
- Hot, humid summers
- Mild to cool winters
- Evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year
- High humidity levels
- Longer growing seasons
- Dense and lush vegetation

#### Closer to the Coast Climate

RTP closer to the coast can be described as having:
- Hot, humid summers with slightly moderated temperatures due to proximity to the ocean
- Mild winters with fewer temperature fluctuations
- Higher humidity and more frequent rainfall
- Stronger coastal influences leading to more stable and moderate temperatures
- Similar growing seasons to in-land areas, but with more salt-tolerant vegetation due to coastal proximity

### The Bay Area’s Climate

California has many vastly different climates. Coastal California (from Marin County and downwards), which includes the Bay Area, has a climate generally described as Mediterranean. 

#### More In-land Climate

The Bay Area's more in-land areas can be described as having:
- Hot, dry summers
- Mild winters with less coastal influence
- Pronounced season contrast with clear dry and wet seasons
- Lush mixed evergreen forests
- High biodiversity with diverse plant and animal life
- Vegetation adapted to both dry summers and wet winters
- Greater susceptibility to wildfires due to dry conditions

#### Closer to the Coast Climate

The Bay Area closer to the coast but not directly on the coast can be described as having:
- Hotter summers with less marine influence
- Mild, wet winters with more significant temperature fluctuations
- Lower humidity compared to the immediate coastal areas
- Pronounced season contrast with clear dry and wet seasons
- Vegetation adapted to dry, hot summers and wetter winters
- Grasslands and savannah-like areas with scattered trees
- Higher risk of wildfires due to dry conditions


## The Bay Area and RTP's Vegetation

### Vegetation closer in-land:

#### Bay Area Mixed-Evergreen Forests:

![Bay Area Mixed-Evergreen Forests](../images/2024-07-13/mixed-evergreen-5.jpeg)

**Key observations:**
- Dark, winding, more moss-covered tree trunks
- Thinner trees
- Darker green leaves
- Darker soil
- An overall brownish tint to the forest
- A variety of conifers and hardwoods
- A lot of shrubs and underbrush

**Connection to climate:**
As seen in the photos, the composition of a rich undergrowth of shrubs along with conifers and hardwoods, which includes a variety of tree species such as redwoods, Douglas firs, and oaks reflect the biodiversity---indicating how much more inviting the Bay Area in-land climate is than the Bay Area climate closer but not next to the coast. The observations of dark, winding, moss-covered tree trunks are adaptations to the region's Mediterranean climate, which is previously characterized by hot, dry summers and wet winters. The thinner trees and darker green leaves are the necessary and vital adaptations to conserve water during the dry season. The brownish tint of the soil further emphasizes the ecosystem's adaptation to seasonal changes, supporting a vibrant mix of flora and fauna resilient to periodic wildfires and droughts.

#### RTP Oak-Hickory Forests:

![RTP Oak-Hickory Forests](../images/2024-07-13/oak-hickory-7.jpeg)

**Key observations:**
- Lighter, straight, and more bare tree trunks
- Taller, upright trees
- Lighter green leaves
- Lighter soil
- An overall light green tint to the forest
- A lack of shrubs and underbrush

**Connection to climate:**
As seen in the photos, RTP's oak-hickory forests present a variety of tall, upright trees predominantly composed of oak and hickory species. The observations of lighter, straighter, and more bare tree trunks are adaptations to in-land RTP's subtropical climate, characterized by hot, humid summers and mild winters with evenly distributed precipitation. The lighter green leaves and lighter soil are the necessary adaptations to higher humidity levels and fertile soils. Underbrush preserves moisture, which explains why there is a lack of it here in these higher humidity levels. These forests support a diverse ecosystem with adaptations to frequent rainfall and moderate temperature fluctuations throughout the year.

### Vegetation closer to the coast:

#### Bay Area Oak Woodlands/Savannahs:

![Bay Area Oak Woodlands/Savannahs](../images/2024-07-13/oak-woodlands-savannah-4.jpeg)

**Key observations:**
- Bunches of trees in crevaces 
- Lack of tree variety; Coast Live Oak being predominant tree
- Stockier, shorter, thicker, and bushier trees
- Leaves remain dark green, but waxy
- Trunks are bare, but remain relatively dark
- Lighter soil
- Grasslands with the occasional tree
- Less underbrush

**Connection to climate:**  
As seen in the photos, near the coast but not directly on the coast, the Bay Area's oak woodlands and savannahs feature a landscape dominated by Coast Live Oaks and grasslands. The observations of stockier, shorter, and bushier trees are adapted to the hotter summers and mild, wet winters with more significant temperature fluctuations highlight the region's Mediterranean climate with distinct dry and wet seasons. The drapery of the trees and their stockier statures reduce surface area exposed to the sun, which allows moisture to be retained through transpiration and reduces heat exposure. The waxy, dark green leaves and lighter soil (which also indicate more nutrient-poor soil) support a varied ecosystem adapted to these conditions, with grasslands and sparse underbrush contributing to the region's biodiversity and higher wildfire risk due to the drier, hotter environment.

#### RTP Pine Woodlands:

![RTP Pine Woodlands](../images/2024-07-13/pine-woodlands-4.jpeg)

**Key observations:**
- Higher conglomeration of trees
- Lack of tree variety; Longleaf Pine being predominant tree
- Taller and lankier trees
- Trunks remain bare, but are darker
- Darker soil
- Foliage are darker
- More underbrush

**Connection to climate:**  
As seen in the photos, RTP's pine woodlands, which are located closer to the coast, show an extremely dense concentration of longleaf pines, which reflect the region's hot, humid summers and mild winters with generally fewer temperature fluctuations---especially closer to the coast. The predominant presence of taller, lankier trees with bare, darker trunks are the adaptations to the higher humidity and frequent rainfall that are generally typical of this climate closer to the coast. As an adaptation to absorb more sunlight in the dense woodland environment, the darker foliage supports the trees' growth and resilience in the exceptionally more humid climate closer to the coast of RTP. The darker soil reflects the fertile and more wet conditions influenced by the coastal proximity, and the stable, moderate temperatures help sustain the lush undergrowth and the dominance of salt-tolerant vegetation.
