March was a completely different story from February. The weather eased up, and the impact of the prolonged rain on the Bay Area’s landscape became very noticeable.

This month’s documentation of the Bay Area’s wilderness had me partaking in two different excursions: one on the 3rd at Stevens Creek Reservoir and one on the 25th at the familiar Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, which you might remember from my earlier posts.

You might be asking yourself, “Why a reservoir?” While reservoirs are not necessarily reflective of nature in its most accurate form because they are man-made (or at least this one is), they still offer insight into the conditions of current wilderness.

Unlike the relentless rain that highlighted the ferocity of nature seen in last month’s photoshoot (which actually occurred only three days before this one), the rain seen in this hike’s photoshoot was more modest. The above photos give the impression of a gentle mist softening the scenery. They capture a serene and almost ethereal beauty. You may also be wondering why the trees in them are noticeably brown despite having experienced a long period of rain. It’s actually because these trees, which comprise mostly *Coast Live Oak*, are suited for the dry Mediterranean climate of the Bay Area. As a result, they have adapted to having a more brownish-green tint to accommodate for the relatively dry climate. As well, a constant bombardment of rain won’t really help them become greener until there’s a prolonged period of sunlight.

In some of the above photos, you can see a **boom**, a floating barrier, floating in the water. Until recently, I didn't even know that these floating barriers had a specific name, booms, let alone what they actually do. It turns out that booms are commonly used in reservoirs to prevent debris from piling up and potentially clogging up spillways. Spillways are where surplus water can flow to prevent the reservoir’s water from flowing over its dam, and you can see what they look like in one of the above photos. With man-made intervention comes man-made solutions. While dams are a reassuring sign of a stable water supply, they're awful for the surrounding ecosystem. They're especially harmful for the aquatic life that rely on these rivers and creeks—that are now dammed up—as passageways (literally and figuratively) for survival. For example, California’s native spring-run Chinook salmon population has drastically decreased because of the presence of dams and other man-made obstacles. In my opinion, California should create reservoirs that are the result of diverted creek and river water instead of damming up entire creeks and rivers altogether, and then use filters to prevent any major aquatic life from entering these diverted pathways. I heard about a recently proposed $4.5 billion massive single-reservoir project that would do just that in California’s Glenn and Colusa counties.[^footnote]

In the above photos, the trees—which are submerged in several feet of water—would have never been able to grow in areas that frequently go underwater. This is no one-time event though. This is the second winter and spring in a row that this happened, and it comes to show just how erratic California's weather has become in such a short amount of time. This is a result of human-induced climate change, and it’s not just limited to California. Many people associate human-induced climate change altogether as just global warming and are confused when they see an increasing number of abnormally cold events during the winter. In fact, many climate change skeptics use this as a basis for their arguments. The truth is, human-induced climate change brings out more extreme weather events along with gradual global warming. In California and the Bay Area, that means extreme rain periods in the winter and blazing temperatures in the summer. As a result, abnormal forest fires in the summer are burning down our native trees at astonishing rates which are being replaced with less trees and more brush—even allowing invasive species to jump in.

## March 24th | Monte Bello Open Space Preserve

This photoshoot was probably the best one I’ve taken so far. Not only did the landscape finally change (a reference to last month’s post), but the slight overcast draped over the sky with blotches of periodic sunlight made for perfect lighting conditions. The weather was similarly perfect as well.

What I love about the above photo is how it’s the natural embodiment of the photography concept *layering*. There are three distinct biomes all in a close proximity, highlighting just how prevalent California’s **ecotones** are. In the foreground, there are the grasslands. In the middleground, there are the highly dense dry-oak woodlands. And in the background, there are the mixed-evergreen forests characterized by more moisture and a good deal of coniferous trees.

The above photo is one of my favorites so far. Highlighting the trisection of its components, this photo follows the photography concept *The Rule of Thirds*, which is why it’s so visually appealing. Just like in the last photo, there are three distinct biomes all in a close proximity.

In last month’s post, I mostly talked about the change in the landscape’s scenery and why it hadn’t occurred yet despite the prolonged rain. I used grass for reference, so if you read last month’s post, you would notice that the grass in the above photo is **much** greener, finally marking the new era of greenery that will last for the next two months or so.

These wet trails in the above photos are a sign that the rain has only recently subsided—that more sunlight is yet to come. I think it looks beautiful in a way.

If you read January’s post, you would know the trees in the above photos are deciduous *Persian Walnut* trees native to central Asia and planted here by humans. You would also know that these trees look exactly the same as they did in January: bare. It might look a little weird since all the surrounding landscape turned green, but that just comes to show how drastically different evergreen and deciduous environments are.

This hike also leads into mixed evergreen forests, where I saw a lot of these decaying trees in the above photos with what appears to be fungi on their branches. Is this Sudden Oak Death? To anyone who might know what it is, please don’t hesitate to let me know.

While in the mixed evergreen forest, I noticed this little guy making his way across the trail in the above photo. This guy belongs to the California newt species. Although cute, they can excrete an extremely potent toxin called tetrodotoxin. For reference, the most poisonous animal in the world, the Blue-ringed octopus, also utilizes this toxin.

On my way out of the mixed evergreen forests, there was a herd of deer as seen in the photos above. Deer are not uncommon to see here in the Bay Area wilderness, but seeing a whole herd is definitely more uncommon. My appearance didn’t seem to scare them off, which comes to show how accustomed wildlife has gotten with humans. These deer are *Columbian Black-tailed deer*—the same species of deer seen in last month’s post.

This photo is also one of my favorites. The tiny hikers alongside the lone, bare oak tree really underscore the vastness of nature. The bareness of the tree may even be why this photo is so striking, but unfortunately, the tree is actually suffering from some disease which has caused it to lose all its foliage.
