Although I talk about March being a completely different story than February in last month’s post because of weather differences and such, April makes its mark by being the first month this year to rid any last resemblance of winter. When I say the vegetation was green this month, I mean it was GREEN. It was surreal to see such a transformation in the activity of wildlife and plants.

## April 28th | Upper Stevens Creek County Park - Canyon Trail Trailhead

This was the first time I came back to this trail since my first post in January, and I can say that it has changed more than any other place I’ve photographed in previous posts, like Monte Bello Open Space preserve and even Stevens Creek Reservoir.

If I didn’t tell you where I took the above photo, you would have probably guessed it was taken somewhere on the East Coast, where the humidity levels are so much higher that everything appears green like this for the majority of the year. In fact, that would actually be a reasonable assumption—even for a nature connoisseur—considering that the Bay Area wilderness doesn’t normally get so much rain as to appear as green as this photo suggests. But, as you know, this photo was 100% taken in the Bay Area. One thing I like about the photo is this sort of juxtaposition between chaos and order in a way that your gaze locks onto a subject and then wanders unpredictably. Specifically, the trail leads your eye to the center of the photo, while the surrounding nature serves to disperse your attention. This type of composition is called **leading lines**. Regarding the nature aspect of this photo, a lot of the trees are leaning and are thinner—and I think I’ve talked about this before in my previous posts—but it highlights the competition for light these trees engage in.

You may recognize this photo. I shared a similar photo in January’s post where I talked about how the heartwood of the trunk reflects the climate it's been exposed to. In January, the **heartwood** was completely orange, highlighting the intense rain it was prolonged to during winter. The change to a brown-grayish color reflects a decrease in moisture levels and an increase in sunlight, which is also reflected in the surrounding vegetation.

What I like about this photo is how it captures a glimpse of Bay Area soil layers beneath the vegetation. Unfortunately, the stratification depicted did not naturally arise. It was created by an excavation company. I have no idea what they were doing, but those gray rocks and pieces of sediments are not natural—they’re pieces of cement. Still, I think this photo offers a unique perspective on the hidden layers beneath the everyday natural scenery we see.

This photo is one of my favorites—not because of the composition, but because of the subject matter itself. The hole in the tree is something you would see from ancient German folklore or something; it’s so eerie and mystical. I’ve been hiking on Stevens Canyon Trail Trailhead since I was eight, and never once have I seen an animal burrowing in it. Perhaps it's too close to the frequently walked-on trail for comfort? I wouldn’t know what type of animal would choose that hole to serve as its home, but if I had to choose one, I would probably choose a squirrel—perhaps even a raccoon.

I’ve hiked this trail for God knows how many times, so imagine my surprise when I noticed this marked branch. My initial thought was that there was some environmental project going on, and it piqued my interest because as someone who knows this trail very well, I want to weigh in on whatever project it is that they’re doing. As of now, I haven’t actually been able to find anything about it. I’ll probably talk to the park ranger to see if he has any information. Nevertheless, why I deemed this photo worthy for the blog is because of its interesting composition. The white tag, smack-dab in the middle, serves to draw the eye, while the branch it’s attached to (which is also in focus) serves to blend into the background in a subtle transition.

What I like about this photo is how it reflects the big difference between the vegetation—specifically trees—in open grasslands and mixed-evergreen forests, which is where this trail—or at least this part of the trail—is located. This single tree on the middle-left side of the photo has over 5 trunks, and it’s just an average coast live oak—the same type of tree spotted in open grasslands with a single, bulky trunk. It’s mind boggling to see that this is evolution in real time, as a single species diverges into two.. Regarding the composition of this photo, I think the trunks serve as *leading lines* in a way that directs one’s eye to the vibrant greenery beyond. The trail also serves as a *leading line*. This photo embodies the diversity of California—how in a few miles you can go from the ecosystem of a dense, mixed evergreen forest to a dry, open grassland.

![Wood rot photo](../images/2024-04-30/IMG_4129%20Large.jpeg)

This photo calls back to three years ago when I first went to **Headwaters Outdoor School**. I remember Tim, the head, teaching us about the complex biological process of wood rot. I remember him specifically telling us that fungi will decompose the wood into these fine particles before the wood completely breaks down and returns to the ecosystem as organic matter. This photo brought feelings of pensiveness. It highlights the endless cycle of birth and death—a cycle that even we as humans, despite our differences from most of nature, cannot escape.

![Wildflowers photo](../images/2024-04-30/IMG_4135%20Large.jpeg)

My discussion of the last photo was quite lugubrious, so I want to end this blog on a good note by talking about this photo. Yes, even we cannot escape death, but the meaning of life lies in the beauty of creation. This photo of blooming wildflowers serves as a powerful reminder that new life can emerge even after periods of darkness. That isn’t a justification for us to create those periods of darkness, like by harming the environment, but rather that there is always hope for fixing what’s broken—it’s why I’m so passionate about protecting the environment.
